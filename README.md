## Project Title:
### Certificate Generation and Validation System using Blockchain

## Team Members:

3. Parithi

## Problem Statement:
The current system of issuing certificates is not secure and can be easily tampered with. The certificates can be easily forged and the authenticity of the certificates cannot be verified. The current system is also time-consuming and requires a lot of manual work. The certificates are also not easily accessible and can be lost or damaged. The current system is also not cost-effective and requires a lot of resources. The current system is also not environmentally friendly and requires a lot of paper.

## Solution:
We propose a Certificate Generation and Validation System using Blockchain. The certificates will be stored on the blockchain and will be tamper-proof. The authenticity of the certificates can be easily verified by anyone. The certificates will be easily accessible and can be easily shared with anyone. The certificates will be cost-effective and will require fewer resources. The certificates will be environmentally friendly and will not require any paper.
